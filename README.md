# ðŸ’¡ Introduction

NannyML Cloud is a web application that allows you to **estimate post-deployment model performance** (without access to targets), detect data drift, and intelligently link data drift alerts back to changes in model performance. Built for data scientists, NannyML Cloud has an easy-to-use interface, interactive visualizations, is completely model-agnostic and currently supports all tabular use cases, classification and **regression**.

NannyML Cloud SDK is a python package that allows you to programatically interact with NannyML Cloud.

Some example use cases:

- Creating a model for monitoring
- Logging inferences for analysis
- Triggering model analysis
